# CurrencyArbitrage
Beautiful Soup &amp; Selenium for webscraping. Bellman Ford negative weight detection for finding arbitrage cycles. Wanted to implement this as it seemed like a very interesting problem.

Currently only supports detection of any Arbitrage opportunity. Planning to work on augmenting this by detecting cycles with the starting currency in.

Uses data from x-rates.com
